This directory contains the interface for the HY-mini HY23D board
running ChibiOS/RT.

As this is not a standard ChibiOS/RT supported board, the necessary board files have
also been provided in the chibios_board directory 

Many thanks to trunet (http://ugfx.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=82) who published 
files for his board. Mine one has the same name, but different controller chips.
However, now it works!
